As John Graham-Cumming announced, CloudFare now offers its own DNS service.
And surprise of the Boss if we believe his words: no history of kept service level !

But what is a DNS server: to make it short, a DNS server makes the correspondence between the IP address of a requested website, and its domain name (forum.xda-developers.com for example).

For the long version a little reading is necessary: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System

The purpose of this module?
Forward all mobile data by their DNS servers.
